	A general procedure to avoid windup which admits a unification of

  abstract = {Approximate Dynamic Inversion has been established as a method to
	control minimum-phase, nonaffine-in-control systems [1]. In this
	report, we re-state the main results of [1], clarify some minor notational
	errors, and prove the same results in an expanded form. In the large,
	the main results of [1] still stand. The development follows [1]
	closely, and no novelty is claimed herein. The purpose of this report
	is mainly to supplement our existing results in [2]-[4] that rely
	heavily on the results of [1].},
