1. To use the ACL Beamer Template, simply copy everything and modify
   ACL_Beamer_Template.tex for your purposes.
2. To install the ACL Latex Beamer theme style files to your Latex
   system, do the following:
   2.1 Copy beamerthemeACL.sty to [beamer-root]/themes/theme
   2.2 Copy beamerouterthemeACL.sty to [beamer-root]/themes/outer
   2.3 On a typical Ubuntu (Linux) system, [beamer-root] resides in:
       /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/beamer
   2.3 Rehash your Latex system. On a typical Ubuntu (Linux) system,
       this is accomplished by issuing the following in a terminal:
       $ sudo texconfig rehash
       followed by your root password.
3. The ACL Latex Beamer theme takes 6 (obviously optional) options:
   logoshiftdown
   logoshiftleft
   titleshrinkwidth
   titleshiftleft
   bottombarleftproportion
   bottombarrightproportion
   so that you can do (for example):
   \usetheme[logoshiftdown = 2pt, logoshiftleft = 2pt,
       titleshrinkwidth = 2.8cm, titleshiftleft = 6mm,
       bottombarleftproportion = 0.25, bottombarrightproportion =
		0.25]{ACL}
   to do adjustments to accomodate your actual logo size, and
   proportions of name and date sections in the bottom bar. The
   default values are adjusted to suit the ACL logo in the figures/
   directory, with 1/3 space allocated for each of the 3 sections in
   the bottom bar.
4. The Makefile can be invoked in a Unix based system like Linux. This
   is non-essential and provided only for convenience. Example uses:
   $ make clean; make
   $ make clean
   $ make
5. Feel free to modify to suit your needs. If you have some
   modifications that can improve the ACL Latex Beamer theme style
   files, feel free to commit changes here.
