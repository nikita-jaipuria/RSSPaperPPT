%%%%%%%%% Title slide
\frame{\titlepage}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide
\begin{frame}[t]{Notes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Intro}: you should use this as a template for embedding videos.  Copy and paste it into your code as necessary
\vspace{12pt}
		\item I've tested this on both Windows and Ubuntu
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Depending on your compiler, you might not be able to see the videos in your compiler's display, but you can view it when you open it in Adobe Reader/Acrobat
		\end{itemize}
\vspace{12pt}
		\item \textbf{However}, I have not been able to get the videos to display properly in Ubuntu
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It correctly compiles - the videos are embedded, but the presentation software can't display it
			\item I've tried Adobe Reader 9, Okular in Ubuntu but have not been able to get videos to display properly
			\item Feel free to edit this if you do get it to work!
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide
\begin{frame}[t]{Notes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Two ways to embed videos in your presentation:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Youtube (or whatever else) links embedded in the player
			\item Local files on your hard drive
		\end{enumerate}
\vspace{12pt}
		\item This uses the media9 package.  You have to make sure it's added - see line 18 of the TeX code
\vspace{24pt}
		\item Start with Youtube videos
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide - THIS IS A YOUTUBE LINK EXAMPLE
\begin{frame}[t]{Youtube Video}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is the baseline example
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{figure}
	\centering
\includemedia[
	    width=0.9\paperwidth,height=0.5\linewidth,
	    activate=pageopen, %Load the video (but you'll have to click the button to start)
	    flashvars={autoPlay=true}
	        ]{}{https://www.youtube.com/v/opsmd5yuBF0} %URL of video
        \end{figure}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide - THIS IS A YOUTUBE LINK EXAMPLE - BETTER BECAUSE IT REMOVES TITLEBAR AND WHATNOT
\begin{frame}[t]{Youtube Video}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This removes the title bar from the top of the video
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{figure}
	\centering
\includemedia[
	    width=0.9\paperwidth,height=0.5\linewidth,
	    activate=pageopen, %Load the video (but you'll have to click the button to start)
	    flashvars={modestbranding=1 % no YT logo in control bar
        		&autohide=1 % controlbar autohide activated
        		&showinfo=0 % no title and other info before start
        		&rel=0 % no related videos after end}
        		}
	        ]{}{https://www.youtube.com/v/opsmd5yuBF0?rel=0} %URL of video (I'm not sure if you need to put the ``?rel=0'' at the end of the URL or in the ``flashvars'' command.  I just put it in both to be safe
        \end{figure}
        %{https://www.youtube.com/v/opsmd5yuBF0}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide
\begin{frame}[t]{Youtube Video}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Important notes:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item If you copy the URL straight from your browser, the link will look like: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opsmd5yuBF0}
\vspace{6pt}
			\item But you can't use that link - you need to replace ``.../watch?v=...'' with ``.../v/...''			\vspace{6pt}
			\item When you copy your link into the beamer code, that same link will now look like:
				\url{https://www.youtube.com/v/opsmd5yuBF0}
\vspace{6pt}
			\item You can also add ``rel=0'' to prevent the related videos from showing up at the end.  New url would look like:
			\url{https://www.youtube.com/v/opsmd5yuBF0?rel=0}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide
\begin{frame}[t]{Youtube Video}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Important notes:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item From what I can tell, the Youtube videos need to use FlashPlayer.  Make sure to install flashplayer \textbf{and} the ActiveX plugin

		\end{itemize}
\vspace{24pt}
		\item Now look at local videos from your hard drive
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide - THIS IS A LOCAL (ON MY HARD DRIVE) EXAMPLE
\begin{frame}[t]{Local Videos}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Can also display videos from your local hard drive
		\begin{itemize}
			\item But it seems to store the video in your slides - your PDF will be large!
			\item I've only tried it with mp4 videos.  Others report that other formats don't seem to work.
			\item Also haven't been able to get a control bar to pop up.  You start the video with a button click
			\begin{itemize}
				\item You can use the spacebar to pause the video and arrow keys to fast forward/rewind
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{figure}
	\centering
\includemedia[
	    width=0.7\paperwidth,height=0.4\linewidth,
	    activate=pageopen, %load the video, but you will need to start it with a button click
	    addresource=movies/acl_intro.mp4, %where the file is located
	    flashvars={source=movies/acl_intro.mp4&autoPlay=true} %where the file is located
	        ]{}{VPlayer.swf}
        \end{figure}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New slide - THIS ONE WORKS TOO (But isn't centered)
%\begin{frame}[t]{Local Videos}
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item This works too
%	\end{itemize}
%\includemedia[
%	    width=0.6\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth,
%	    activate=pageopen,
%	    addresource=movies/Jack_ACC2017_vdp.mp4,
%	    flashvars={source=movies/Jack_ACC2017_vdp.mp4&autoPlay=true}
