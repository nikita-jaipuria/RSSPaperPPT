		\item Here's how you can overlay text
\pause
		\item So that you can leave it temporarily blurred out
\pause
		\item One of the easiest ways to do so is with the \verb|\pause| command

			\item Here's the code I just used:

\item Here's how you can overlay text
\pause
\item So that you can leave it temporarily blurred out
\pause
\item One of the easiest ways to do so is with the
			\end{lstlisting}
\pause
			\item Each \verb|\pause| command hides the text that follows and they stack upon each other

		\item<1-4> Another way to do it is within the itemize framework
\vspace{0.1in}
		\item<2-> When you command \verb|\item|, you can specify in which frame(s) the text will be displayed
		\begin{itemize}
			\item You just have to add ``$<$frame number(s)$>$'' immediately after \verb|\item|
			\item Example: \verb|\item<2>| will only display the text in the second frame
			\item<3-> You can also make them stay visible using a hyphen
			\item<3-> Example: \verb|\item<2->| will display the text in the second and all subsequent frames
		\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.1in}
		\item<4-> You can also use that to make text disappear
		\begin{itemize}
			\item<5-> See what just happened with the first bullet point?
			\item<5-> I used \verb|\item<1-4>| to make it disappear after the fourth frame
		\end{itemize}

		\item Lastly, another simple option is to just make two copies of the same slide, one with additional material
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Can use the \verb|\addtocounter{framenumber}{-1}| command we discussed to freeze the frame counter
			\item This is particularly useful when you have figures because the previous two methods have problems
		\end{itemize}

		\item You can also try more advanced commands such as \verb|\only<2->| or \verb|\visible<2->| or \verb|\uncover<2->|
		\begin{itemize}
			\item They all have their own nuances, Google it if you think you need to use them
