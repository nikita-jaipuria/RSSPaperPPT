%%%%%%%%% Before we start putting the presentation together, need to declare formating and packages %%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Standard packages%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\usepackage{algorithm,algorithmic}  %2 packages for making nice looking algorithms
\usepackage{amsmath,mathtools} %Standard math commands (like vectors, symbols, etc.)
\usepackage{epsfig,epstopdf} %You need these if you have .eps vector graphics (recommend if possible)
%\usepackage{tikz} %Sometimes you may want to use Tikz to make figures (but its pretty complicated)
\usepackage{media9} %If you want to include movies (like in my earlier presentation) you'll need this package
%%% Below are packages commonly used for making figures
\usepackage{subfigure,MnSymbol,pdfpages}
\usepackage{graphicx,color,colortbl}
\usepackage{bm,amsfonts,graphics}

\usepackage{listings} %You won't need this unless youre displaying source code - I DONT RECOMMEND YOU DO THIS YET



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Commands for making the ACL slide format %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\setbeamercolor{block title}{bg=blue!55,fg=black}%bg=background, fg= foreground
\setbeamercolor{block body}{bg=blue!20,fg=black}%bg=background, fg= foreground
\renewcommand{\vec}[1]{\mathbf{#1}} %Changes the ``vec'' command for vectors to bold font rather than arrows overhead
\input{beamerstuff} %Contains most of the commands for formatting 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Nice pop up text blocks from Shih-Yuan %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\usepackage[absolute,overlay]{textpos} %Packages needed for the popup textbox
\newenvironment{myfootnote}[3]{%
\begin{textblock*}{#3}(#1,#2) 
\tiny\begingroup\color{blue!50!black}}{\endgroup\end{textblock*}} %These 3 lines are all one command

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[t]{SVN Background}
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item What is SVN?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Version control software
			\item Similar to Github, Dropbox, Bitbucket - but with a few differences
		\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.2in}
		\item First need to install a subversion client
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Windows: TortoiseSVN - \url{https://tortoisesvn.net/}
			\item Ubuntu: RabbitVCS - \url{http://rabbitvcs.org/}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Can install with the following terminal commands \\
				sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rabbitvcs/ppa \\
				sudo apt-get update \\
				sudo apt-get install rabbitvcs-nautilus3 \\
				sudo apt-get install rabbitvcs-gedit \\
				sudo apt-get install rabbitvcs-cli
			\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
\vspace{0.2in}
		\item Then you need your username and password for our repos
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[t]{Pulling from the Repo}
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item We have two repositories
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Intra-lab (primary) repo: \url{svn://hohmann.mit.edu/acl}
			\item Inter-lab repo: \url{svn://hohmann.mit.edu/acl_collab}
		\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.2in}
		\item If there isn't one already, add your own folder to the repo
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Example: \url{svn://hohmann.mit.edu/acl/JackQ}
		\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.2in}
		\item To pull from existing folders you can use ``checkout'' or ``export''
		\begin{itemize}
			\item ``Checkout'' will download the folder onto your computer AND maintain a link to the folder stored on the SVN server
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Allows you to push new or modified material back to the SVN server and update your computer's copy of the folder if someone else changes it
			\end{itemize}
			\item ``Export'' will only download the folder onto your computer
			\begin{itemize}
				\item It's a one-time download of the folder, no pushing or updates
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[t]{Pulling from the Repo}
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item Once you have checkout a folder, you can update your local copy using the ``Update'' command
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This will download any changes you or anyone else had uploaded to the SVN server onto your local copy of the material
		\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.2in}
		\item Sometimes you might want to reverse changes you made to the local (your computer's) copy of the fiile(s)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Use the ``Revert'' command to reverse any local changes you made and revert the file(s) back to the copy on the SVN server
		\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.2in}
		\item If you accidentally made changes to an outdated local copy and want to incorporate them into the more-up-to-date SVN copy, it's a little trickier
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Google ``resolve conflicts SVN'' and look at the particular issue you're having
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[t]{Pushing to the Repo}
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item Once you're ready to add new file(s) or folders to the SVN server, it's a two-step process
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item First, need to use the ``add'' command on each file/folder you want to add
		\begin{itemize}
			\item When ``adding'' a folder, be careful because it will also select all files/folders within the folder - make sure you deselect those you don't want added to the SVN server
		\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.1in}
		\item Once you ``added'' the file or folder, use the ``commit'' command to actually add the file/folder to the SVN server
		\begin{itemize}
			\item You can also add a comment in the commit detailing what is being added and why
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[t]{Removing from the Repo}
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item If you want to remove files from the repository, there are two ways of doing so
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item ``Unversion'' the file
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Remove the file from the repository, but does NOT delete your local copy
		\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.1in}
		\item ``Delete'' the file - note it's ``SVN $\longrightarrow$ delete'' not just the normal Windows/Ubuntu delete
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Removes the file from the repository, but will also delete your local copy
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item You will also need to ``commit'' these commands before they take effect
		\item Before it's committed, you can undo a deletion with ``Revert''
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
